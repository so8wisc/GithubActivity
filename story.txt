Once upon a time there was a young princess who played in the woods outsider her castle. She tossed a perfect golden ball up in the air and caught over and over again, until she accidentally dropped her golden ball in a well! 

Eventually, the princess found the shiny crystal lying on the top of the hill. She picked it up, took it back to the well, and threw it down to the frog. The frog caught the crystal and immediately swallowed it. Magic happened that the frog turned into a river god and flew up the well. He not only brought the princess's golden ball with him but also gave her a bottle of tears as a gift. "It can cure any disease in this world. Please bring my thanks to your father." the river god said. The princess gave the tears to her father then her father became healthy. They lived a happy life after.
