Once upon a time there was a young princess who played in the woods outsider her castle. She tossed a perfect golden ball up in the air and caught over and over again, until she accidentally dropped her golden ball in a well! 
The princess looked at the well, there is a frog down there! The frog asked princess for a crystal at the top of the hill to exchange the golden ball. The princess agreed and went up the hill, trying to find the crystal.
Eventually, the princess found the shiny crystal lying on the top of the hill. She picked it up, took it back to the well, and threw it down to the frog. The frog caught the crystal and immediately swallowed it. Magic happened that the frog turned into a river god and flew up the well. He not only brought the princess's golden ball with him but also gave her a bottle of tears as a gift. "It can cure any disease in this world. Please bring my thanks to your father." the river god said. The princess gave the tears to her father then her father became healthy. They lived a happy life after.
Until one day when the lightning struck the princess's castle. The castle was set a blaze. The princess had a distant memory of this river god that once performed this miracle in saving her father. She quickly lept to her feet trying to remember exactly where to locate him. She traversed past the fiery stairs and down into the forest to see that the place where she thought the river to be had dried up. "Is this it," she thought to herself. Just when she thought all hope was lost she saw a glimmer in the mud where the puddle had been. "Aha," the princess screamed. Its the crystal. The princess picked up the crystal and wished for a heavy rain to put out the fires. Her heroic actions that day saved countless lives including that of her now healthy fire. The End.
